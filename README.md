# fitlyTest1.4
adapting ethanopp 's fitly package for PMT/viz testing
https://github.com/ethanopp/fitly

probably only going to use/modify a few of the created visualizations, more likely I will try to integrate the scripts with garmin activity and daily (ambient/non-activity) files and manual entries since that is the database system I prefer over Strava and the other integrations he has quite adeptly linked
